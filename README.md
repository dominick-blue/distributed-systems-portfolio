# Distributed Systems Projects Portfolio
## By Dominick Blue

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio of distributed systems projects! This repository showcases my work on building scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-performing systems using modern technologies such as Java, AWS, frontend frameworks, and distributed databases.

Each project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and deploy complex systems that solve real-world problems across various domains, from e-commerce and real-time chat applications to video streaming and IoT sensor monitoring.

## About Me

I am passionate about building systems that solve complex, large-scale problems. With expertise in Java, cloud infrastructure, and distributed system design, I aim to contribute to teams at organizations that value innovation, scalability, and performance.

Feel free to explore the projects in this repository, and if you have any questions or would like to collaborate, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!

## Why This Portfolio?

These projects are designed to showcase my ability to:
- Architect and develop distributed systems that can scale to handle millions of requests.
- Implement high-availability systems using cloud services like AWS.
- Build end-to-end applications, from backend microservices to user-facing frontends.
- Apply modern database and messaging technologies for fast, reliable data storage and communication.
- Use DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS to deploy and manage complex systems in production environments.
