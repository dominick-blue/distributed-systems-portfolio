# Distributed Systems Projects Portfolio
## By Dominick Blue

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio of distributed systems projects! This repository showcases my work on building scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-performing systems using modern technologies such as Java, AWS, frontend frameworks, and distributed databases.

Each project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and deploy complex systems that solve real-world problems across various domains, from e-commerce and real-time chat applications to video streaming and IoT sensor monitoring.

## Technologies

These projects are built using the following core technologies:

- **Java**: The primary backend language for developing distributed services and microservices.
- **AWS**: Leveraging cloud infrastructure for scalable storage, compute, and networking.
- **Frontend Frameworks**:
    - **React**, **Angular**, **Vue.js**, and **Svelte** for interactive, responsive UIs.
- **Databases**:
    - **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, **DynamoDB**, **Cassandra**, and **Redis** for reliable data storage and caching.
- **Other Technologies**: Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, WebSockets, Prometheus, and Grafana for containerization, orchestration, messaging, and monitoring.

## Projects

### 1. [Microservices E-commerce Platform](link-to-project-1)
- An e-commerce platform built using a microservices architecture, with services for user management, order processing, payments, and inventory.
- **Technologies**: Java (Spring Boot), React, PostgreSQL, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS).

### 2. [Real-Time Chat Application](link-to-project-2)
- A real-time messaging system with WebSocket-based communication, supporting thousands of concurrent users.
- **Technologies**: Java (Spring Boot), Vue.js, Redis, AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB).

### 3. [Distributed Task Scheduler](link-to-project-3)
- A scalable task scheduling system that distributes tasks across multiple nodes, built for large-scale batch processing.
- **Technologies**: Java, React (TypeScript), PostgreSQL, AWS (SQS, ECS).

### 4. [Distributed Logging and Monitoring System](link-to-project-4)
- A system to collect, store, and analyze logs from distributed services in real-time.
- **Technologies**: Java, Next.js, ElasticSearch, AWS (CloudWatch, S3).

### 5. [Cloud-Based File Sharing Tool](link-to-project-5)
- A platform for real-time file sharing and collaboration, built with a distributed backend.
- **Technologies**: Java (Spring Boot), React, AWS (S3, CloudFront, Cognito).

### 6. [Distributed Video Streaming Platform](link-to-project-6)
- A scalable video streaming service with adaptive video delivery and content distribution.
- **Technologies**: Java, React, Cassandra, AWS (Elastic Transcoder, CloudFront).

### 7. [Distributed Search Engine](link-to-project-7)
- A distributed search engine that indexes and provides efficient querying across multiple nodes.
- **Technologies**: Java, Angular, ElasticSearch, AWS (RDS, S3).

### 8. [Distributed Auction System](link-to-project-8)
- A real-time auction platform with distributed bid synchronization and high availability.
- **Technologies**: Java (Spring Boot), Vue.js, MongoDB, AWS (DynamoDB, Lambda).

### 9. [Distributed IoT Sensor Monitoring System](link-to-project-9)
- An IoT sensor monitoring system for real-time data collection and analytics, built on a distributed architecture.
- **Technologies**: Java, React (D3.js), InfluxDB, AWS (IoT Core, Lambda).

## Why This Portfolio?

These projects are designed to showcase my ability to:
- Architect and develop distributed systems that can scale to handle millions of requests.
- Implement high-availability systems using cloud services like AWS.
- Build end-to-end applications, from backend microservices to user-facing frontends.
- Apply modern database and messaging technologies for fast, reliable data storage and communication.
- Use DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS to deploy and manage complex systems in production environments.
