- [ ] Ensure real-time inventory updates when orders are placed or canceled.
- [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests.
- [ ] Dockerize the Inventory Service.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` for Inventory Service with relevant instructions.

---

### 6. **API Gateway**
- [ ] Set up the API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway or Netflix Zuul.
- [ ] Route traffic to the appropriate microservice (user, order, payment, inventory).
- [ ] Implement rate limiting, authentication, and logging at the gateway level.
- [ ] Write integration tests for the API Gateway.
- [ ] Dockerize the API Gateway.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` for the API Gateway with relevant instructions.

---

### 7. **Frontend (React/Angular/Vue.js)**
- [ ] Set up the frontend framework (React/Angular/Vue.js) with TypeScript.
- [ ] Create a responsive design for the user-facing interface.
- [ ] Implement user authentication (using JWT).
- [ ] Build product listing, shopping cart, and checkout flow.
- [ ] Implement real-time order updates and notifications.
- [ ] Integrate payment processing via the Payment Service API.
- [ ] Dockerize the frontend application.
- [ ] Write unit tests for UI components.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` for the frontend with relevant instructions.

---

### 8. **Database Setup**
- [ ] Set up **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** databases for all microservices.
- [ ] Write scripts for database migrations and initialization (e.g., using Liquibase or Flyway for SQL databases).
- [ ] Ensure that all services communicate correctly with their respective databases.
- [ ] Implement proper indexing and query optimization for performance.

---

### 9. **Infrastructure and AWS Integration**
- [ ] Set up AWS **S3** for storing product images.
- [ ] Use **RDS** for managing relational databases (PostgreSQL).
- [ ] Use **EC2** or **ECS** for deploying microservices.
- [ ] Implement **Elastic Load Balancer** for load distribution across services.
- [ ] Set up **CloudWatch** for logging and monitoring.
- [ ] Implement **SNS/SQS** for messaging between services (e.g., order placement and payment confirmation).

---

### 10. **Security**
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication across all services.
- [ ] Ensure secure API endpoints (e.g., via HTTPS).
- [ ] Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for different users (admin, customer).
- [ ] Perform security audits to check for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).

---

### 11. **Testing & Documentation**
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for all microservices.
- [ ] Write integration tests to ensure microservices interact as expected.
- [ ] Write end-to-end tests for the entire platform (both frontend and backend).
- [ ] Document each service and the overall architecture in the root `README.md`.
- [ ] Include API documentation (using Swagger/OpenAPI).
- [ ] Add deployment instructions to the main `README.md`.

---

### 12. **CI/CD and Deployment**
- [ ] Set up a continuous integration pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions or Jenkins) for automated testing.
- [ ] Set up continuous delivery for deploying services to AWS.
- [ ] Use **Docker Compose** for local development and testing.
- [ ] Implement **Kubernetes** (EKS on AWS) for orchestrating containers.
- [ ] Ensure automated scaling based on traffic (AWS Auto Scaling).
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerts using **AWS CloudWatch** and **Prometheus/Grafana**.
