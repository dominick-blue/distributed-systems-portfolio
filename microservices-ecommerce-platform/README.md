- [ ] Connect the **Order Service** to the database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
- [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests for the **Order Service**.
- [ ] Dockerize the **Order Service**.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` for the **Order Service** with relevant instructions.

---

### 6. **Payment Service (Payment Processing)**
- [ ] Implement third-party payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- [ ] Design the payment model (e.g., Payment entity with fields like payment id, order id, amount, payment status).
- [ ] Implement secure payment processing, including success/failure handling.
- [ ] Connect the **Payment Service** to the database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
- [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests for the **Payment Service**.
- [ ] Dockerize the **Payment Service**.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` for the **Payment Service** with relevant instructions.

---

### 7. **API Gateway (Routing and Security)**
- [ ] Set up the API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway or Netflix Zuul.
- [ ] Route traffic to the appropriate microservice (User, Order, Payment, Inventory).
- [ ] Implement rate limiting, authentication, and logging at the gateway level.
- [ ] Write integration tests for the API Gateway.
- [ ] Dockerize the API Gateway.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` for the API Gateway with relevant instructions.

---

### 8. **Frontend (React/Angular/Vue.js)**
- [ ] Set up the frontend framework (React/Angular/Vue.js) with TypeScript.
- [ ] Create a responsive design for the user-facing interface.
- [ ] Implement user authentication (using JWT).
- [ ] Build product listing, shopping cart, and checkout flow.
- [ ] Implement real-time order updates and notifications.
- [ ] Integrate payment processing via the Payment Service API.
- [ ] Dockerize the frontend application.
- [ ] Write unit tests for UI components.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` for the frontend with relevant instructions.

---

### 9. **Security**
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication across all services.
- [ ] Ensure secure API endpoints (e.g., via HTTPS).
- [ ] Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for different users (admin, customer).

---

### 10. **Testing & Documentation**
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for all microservices.
